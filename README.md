<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>An automated decision support system (DSS) to optimize rain gauge network in the urbanized Klang river basin was developed for this study. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used for its visualization and spatial analysis capability. The suitability of each rain gauge location was evaluated based on the statistical properties of rainfall. An automated evaluation process for each rain gauge site was completed with an algorithm in ArcGIS 9.2 by using Visual Basic for Application (VBA) to develop a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). A total of 30 rainfall events were analyzed, involving 19 rain gauges in the river basin. Cross-validation analysis of the rainfall stations was performed using ordinary kriging interpolation method. Comparisons between the measured and interpolated values for each station for point measurement and mean areal rainfall (MAR) were made based on their statistical properties. Based on the error distribution analysis, the exponential semivariogram model performed slightly better than Gaussian and spherical models. The rainfall stations with the lowest variance and standard deviation, and correlation coefficient (<i>r</i>) closest to unity are considered redundant. The <i>r</i> values range from -0.538 to 0.922 for point measurement and 0.975 to 0.996 for MAR. This DSS is able to determine one redundant gauge at a time. It is found that with only 19 stations available, the opportunity to remove any station is very limited. For MAR, the <i>r</i> values decrease rapidly whereas the variance increases following the removal of only one station. As for point measurement, the <i>r</i> values also decrease but the variance does not indicate any conclusive pattern. Therefore, this study suggests that all the existing rainfall stations are to be maintained.</p>
